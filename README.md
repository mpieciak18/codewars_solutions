# codewars_solutions

This contains a number of my solutions for CodeWars problems.

This repo is organized by "kyu", where a smaller "kyu" means the problem is more difficult. "Kyu" ranges from 8 (absolute beginner) to 1 (master).

Currently, this repo only contains answers to Python problems, although this will soon expand to include Javascript problems as well.
